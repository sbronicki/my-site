<h1 id="name">Stanley E Bronicki II</h1>
<h2 id="ffed">Future Front End Developer</h2>
<p>I recently graduated from NJIT with a bachelor's in physics, though currently I'm studying independently <br>
    to become a software engineer. In light of my recent decision to switch career paths I've been learning<br>
    all that I can about front end web development, particularly HTML/CSS, JAVASCRIPT, C++ & GIT.<br>
    I'm determined, logical and a quick learner with a wide range of technical and problem-solving skills<br>
    so for me this journey so far, although difficult has been incredibly rewarding and yet it is only just beginning.<br>
    I look forward to continuing the development of my skills as well as all the projects I'll take on in the future.<br> 
    My main goal at this time is to hone my web development skills to the point that I am able to work professionally <br>
    for a company who will provide me with challenges and opportunities which I can use to further increase my <br>
    effectiveness as a software engineer!
